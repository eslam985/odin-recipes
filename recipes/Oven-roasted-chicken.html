            <p>Oven-roasted chicken is a healthy and delicious option, where the chicken is marinated in a mixture
                of
                vegetables
                and spices for a robust flavor and a crispy exterior. This method ensures the chicken remains moist
                and
                retains
                its internal juices, making it suitable for large gatherings.</p>

                <h3>Preparation method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Blend all the vegetables and spices together in the blender, but the mixture will be coarsely
                        chopped.
                    </li>
                    <li>We put the mixture on the chicken and leave it for a while, maybe an hour or more, maybe
                        overnight.</li>
                    <li>Remove the excess marinade before putting it in the oven.</li>
                    <li>We turn on the oven on high heat and put an empty tray to heat up and put the chicken on the
                        tray from
                        time
                        to time, turning the chicken over and that’s it. It doesn’t take long. After half an hour, we
                        can find
                        it
                        cooked. Please do not leave it for a long time so that it does not become dry and retains its
                        juice.
                    </li>
