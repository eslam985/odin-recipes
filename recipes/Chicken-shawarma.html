    <p>Shawarma is a popular dish in the Middle East, featuring carefully marinated and slow-cooked pieces of chicken.
        This simple homemade recipe offers a quick and easy fried shawarma with fresh vegetables, perfect served with
        rice or tortillas.</p>
    <h3>the components</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 chicken breast, and you can add more as desired. Cut into strips lengthwise.</li>
        <li>3 bell peppers and 3 long peppers</li>
        <li>1 onion, julienned</li>
        <li>4 tomatoes, or the appropriate number, cut lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Oil, Salt, pepper, bay leaf, and ground cardamom are all optional.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>We soak the chicken and lemon and cut it into lengthwise slices.</li>
        <li>Then we prepare the julienned onions, lengthwise cut tomatoes, bell peppers, long green peppers, and two or
            three cloves of garlic, depending on the quantity.</li>
        <li>We heat the oil, but do not burn it, and put the chicken slices in it to take the shock and sauté them a
            little. After that, we add the onions and sauté them a little more, and we add the tomatoes so that they do
            not get cooked too much, and the pepper and garlic until they boil. We reduce the heat and wait until it is
            ready.</li>
        <li>You can also put it under the grill in the oven and serve it with pasta or vermicelli rice. Enjoy!♥️</li>
