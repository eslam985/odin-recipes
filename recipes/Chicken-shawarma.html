                <ol>
                    <li>We soak the chicken and lemon and cut it into lengthwise slices.</li>
                    <li>Then we prepare the julienned onions, lengthwise cut tomatoes, bell peppers, long green peppers,
                        and
                        two
                        or
                        three cloves of garlic, depending on the quantity.</li>
                    <li>We heat the oil, but do not burn it, and put the chicken slices in it to take the shock and
                        sauté
                        them a
                        little. After that, we add the onions and sauté them a little more, and we add the tomatoes so
                        that
                        they
                        do
                        not get cooked too much, and the pepper and garlic until they boil. We reduce the heat and wait
                        until it
                        is
                        ready.</li>
                    <li>You can also put it under the grill in the oven and serve it with pasta or vermicelli rice.
